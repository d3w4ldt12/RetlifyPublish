                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to SightLine, the innovative eye-tracking solution aimed at people with disabilities
                    and anyone seeking hands-free digital accessibility. Imagine navigating your device, browsing the web,
                    and completing tasks efficiently just by where you look. Our smart lens harnesses cutting-edge eye-tracking
                    technology to empower users, bringing seamless and intuitive control to those with limited mobility or a
                    preference for hands-free interaction.

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h2>How SightLine Works</h2>
            <p>
                SightLine works by tracking the position of your pupils and then determining what you are looking at based
                on where they are facing. In order to use this tool, you must complete the calibration feature. This works
                by having you look at a dot on the screen and then clicking once. Once the current is calibrated, you can
                now move the mouse based on your face.
            </p>
            <p>
                This breakthrough tool represents a significant step towards a future where digital experiences align with
                human intent, operating at the speed of thought. By transforming eye movements into actionable commands,
                we aspire to replace cumbersome input devices and significantly improve convenience for all users.
                Join us in shaping the future of digital interaction—one that is more inclusive, accessible, and
                intuitively responsive.

                    <p><strong>Left Click with Two Blinks:</strong> When the system detects two quick blinks in succession, it simulates a left mouse click. This could be used for actions such as selecting items, opening files, or activating buttons.</p>
                    <p><strong>Right Click with Three Blinks:</strong> Three quick blinks would trigger a right mouse click, allowing users to access context menus or secondary actions that typically require a right-click.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Calibration</h3>
                    <p>Allows users to calibrate the blink detection sensitivity to accommodate individual differences in blink rate and duration.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>User-Friendly Interface</h3>
                    <p>Simple, intuitive design that allows easy navigation for users of all abilities.</p>
